	<p>Since 1982, Big Smoke has been smoking foods with distinct flavors from spices, seasonings, vegetables, meat sauces, and dips.The truck is equipped with a grill but smoking is its specialty.  Big Smoke operates with a menu that rotates often and has added a little smoke to just about anything you can think of. We have cooked  our food with cold, hot, and rotisserie style smoking, while being dressed in smoking oils and seasoned with dry rubs. This is the most important part of Big Smoke's cooking process, because each method creates a different taste. Come experience Big Smoke and get smoked!!</p><p>Essentially a smokehouse on wheels, Big Smoke is an active vendor that pops up twice a week at many events around the city from art shows, concerts, to sports games, and conventions. Unlike other food trucks, its known for its barebeued chicken, strawberry sauces, briskets, and smoked vegetables Big Smoke may be reserved for caterings, your pecial events, and hungry parties. This truck has always been a dream of Big Smoke. Originally starting their career path in the service industry and business, Big Smoke was mainly inspired by the many chefs of of her past to combine her knowledge and resources to create her own platform that will provide nourishment to others, inspiring others, and doing what she loves.</p>
